# Zack's Vulkan Engine

This is the main repo for my Vulkan-based game engine

I don't have a name for it, but I'm thinking of calling it the 'Last Gen Engine' because of it's focus on optimizing for last gen features that systems like VR and mobile are stuck with

This engine is not meant to replace things like Unreal Engine, Unity, or Godot

It was made for these purposes:

- It was fun for me to make (kinda the main reason)
- To be a light-weight, flexible engine for me to test out graphics features
- To be show-cased on my portfolio
- To replace old versions of Direct X in games like FlatOut 2 to get better graphics out of them (more on that when I make more progress on it).

## Features
- Dynamic shadows from spot lights and sun lights, with baked GI/AO maps to increase fidelity
- 4x the speed of Unreal Engine
- Graphics features you'd expect in a modern(ish) engine like SSR, motion blur, bloom, chromatic abberation, and vignette.
- My own tone mapper based on AGX used in Blender, which I call Approximate-AGX or AAGX for short
- The level editor is Blender

## Comparisons

Here's some comparison shots

*All of the levels are from other games, I already did enough 3D modelling at my day job so I went the easy route, which means they aren't the best showcases of what's possible with the engine*

### Unreal Engine vs My Engine

Unreal Engine has features like lumen and volumetric fog disabled, while things like baked AO are enabled to try and make it an apples to apples comparison.

Blender is using Cycles
